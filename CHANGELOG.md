# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). GitHub Releases correspond only to published container images; repository-only changes remain under `Unreleased` until the next image release. See [docs/VERSION.md](docs/VERSION.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Restricted OpenShift qualification fixtures, policy tests, full operator procedure, and architecture diagram.
- Security-control/SCTM planning, FIPS and host-support boundaries, and a repository-native SVG architecture suite.
- Initial Red Hat UBI 9 Micro packaging for ClickHouse Server.
- Hardened non-root runtime, automated tests, vulnerability scanning, SBOM and provenance generation, and keyless release signing.
- Cross-platform line-ending rules and pre-commit checks for repository hygiene, shell scripts, container files, GitHub Actions, and prohibited commit trailers.
- Immutable GitHub Action references, workflow security auditing, configuration scanning, and expanded runtime smoke coverage.
- OpenSSF Scorecard publishing, CodeQL analysis for GitHub Actions, hash-locked CI tooling, CODEOWNERS, and signed GitHub release evidence.
- Syft SPDX SBOM generation and Grype vulnerability gates for CI and release images, with SARIF and release artifacts retained according to their useful lifecycle.
- First-release roadmap, repository badge policy, and contributor-facing CI and artifact documentation.
- A documented container and repository versioning and release standard.
- CI security-layer, enforcement, result-review, and Endor Labs guidance.
- Structured bug reporting and pull-request review checklists.
- Production, TLS, disconnected-deployment, vulnerability-triage, upstream-license, and official-image comparison documentation.
- Entrypoint initialization and health checks over TLS-only native-port configurations.
- Complete Grype JSON inventories, including unfixed findings, retained beside the fixed High/Critical blocking result in CI and release runs.
- Explicit ClickHouse TGZ component records in SPDX inventories and a keyless, digest-bound complete SPDX release attestation.
- Rootless storage guidance for named volumes, bind mounts, Kubernetes/OpenShift identities, custom data paths, additional disks, SELinux, and NFS.
- Native AMD64 and ARM64 CI builds, smoke tests, vulnerability evidence, and release-manifest architecture validation.
- Explicit repository scope and official-image storage compatibility guidance, including the XML-based replacement for the unreleased `CLICKHOUSE_DATA_DIR` interface.
- Podman-first user procedures, a tested Podman support baseline, and rootless user-namespace permission guidance.
- Native CA-issued TLS rehearsal covering HTTPS, native TCP, connected/disconnected outbound trust, negative cases, renewal, rollback, and operator evidence procedures.
- Dedicated loopback-only TLS health client configuration that supports CA-issued certificate chains without weakening server-side outbound verification.

### Changed

- The entrypoint now derives primary and additional writable directories from the effective ClickHouse configuration, rejects the misleading `CLICKHOUSE_DATA_DIR` variable, and reports non-root permission failures before server startup.
